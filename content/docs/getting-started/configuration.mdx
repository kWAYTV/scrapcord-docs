# Basic Configuration

This guide will help you configure Scrapcord for your server. We'll go through each section of the `config.yaml` file and explain what each setting does.

<Callout type="warning">
  Never share your configuration file with others as it contains sensitive information like API keys and tokens.
</Callout>

## Configuration File Structure

<Steps>
    <Step>
        **APP Section**
        <Tabs items={["Basic", "Custom"]}>
            <Tab>
                ```yaml
                # [APP]
                app_logo: "https://i.imgur.com/Efcf2oN.png"
                app_name: "Scrapcord"
                app_url: "https://scrapcord.club"
                app_version: 0.0.1
                log_file: "scrapcord.log"
                ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab>

## Required Permissions

<Callout type="info">
Ensure your bot has these Discord permissions:

You can generate an invite link with the correct permissions in the Discord Developer Portal.
