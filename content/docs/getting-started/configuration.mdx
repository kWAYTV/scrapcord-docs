# Basic Configuration

This guide will help you configure Scrapcord for your server. We'll go through each section of the `config.yaml` file and explain what each setting does.

## Configuration File Structure

The `config.yaml` file is divided into several sections:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        **APP Section**
        ```yaml
        # [APP]
        app_logo: "https://i.imgur.com/Efcf2oN.png"
        app_name: "Scrapcord"
        app_url: "https://scrapcord.club"
        app_version: 0.0.1
        log_file: "scrapcord.log"
        ```
        These settings control the bot's branding and basic functionality:
        - `app_logo`: URL for the bot's logo (used in embeds)
        - `app_name`: Name of your bot instance
        - `app_url`: Your bot's website URL
        - `app_version`: Current version number
        - `log_file`: Name of the log file
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **BOT Section**
        ```yaml
        # [BOT]
        bot_prefix: "."
        bot_token: "YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
        dev_guild_id: 123456789
        logs_channel: 123456789
        ```
        Essential Discord bot settings:
        - `bot_prefix`: Command prefix for legacy commands
        - `bot_token`: Your Discord bot token
        - `dev_guild_id`: Your development server's ID
        - `logs_channel`: Channel ID for bot logs

        <Callout type="warning">
            Never share your `bot_token`! Keep it private and secure.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **PTERODACTYL Section**
        ```yaml
        # [PTERODACTYL]
        ptero_panel_url: "https://panel.example.com"
        ptero_api_key: "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
        ```
        Pterodactyl panel connection settings:
        - `ptero_panel_url`: Your panel's URL
        - `ptero_api_key`: Client API key from Pterodactyl

        <Callout type="warning">
            Keep your `ptero_api_key` private! It provides access to your servers.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Required Permissions

Ensure your bot has these Discord permissions:
- Administrator (for managing channels and roles)
- Send Messages & Embeds
- Read Message History
- Use Slash Commands

<Callout>
    You can generate an invite link with the correct permissions in the Discord Developer Portal.
</Callout>

## Pterodactyl API Key Setup

To get your Pterodactyl API key:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        Log into your Pterodactyl panel
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Go to Account Settings (top-right corner)
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Navigate to the API Credentials tab
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Create a new API key with these permissions:
        - Read Server Status
        - Send Server Commands
        - Create Server Backups
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Copy the API key and paste it in your `config.yaml`
    </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout type="error">
    The API key is shown only once when created. If you lose it, you'll need to generate a new one.
</Callout>
