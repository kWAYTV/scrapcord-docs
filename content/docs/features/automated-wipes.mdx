# Automated Wipes

Scrapcord can automatically wipe your Rust servers on a schedule. This guide explains how to configure and manage automated wipes.

<Callout type="info">
  All times are in UTC. Make sure to convert your local time to UTC when scheduling wipes.
</Callout>

## Wipe Process

When a wipe is executed, Scrapcord follows these steps:

<Steps>
    <Step>
        **Pre-Wipe Commands**
        - Executes configured pre-wipe commands
        - Useful for announcements or preparation tasks
        
        <Callout type="note">
          Commands are executed in order with a 2-second delay between each command.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Server Shutdown**
        - Stops the server gracefully
        - Force kills if configured and server doesn't stop
        
        <Callout type="warning">
          Force kill should be used with caution as it may cause data corruption.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Server Reinstall**
        - Optionally reinstalls server if configured
        - Waits for installation to complete
        
        <Callout type="note">
          Reinstalling can help resolve plugin issues but takes longer to complete.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Map Update**
        - Generates new map seed or uses custom URL
        - Updates server variables
        
        <Tabs items={["Random Seed", "Seed Range", "Custom Map"]}>
            <Tab>
                ```yaml
                world_seeds:
                  - seed: "random"
                    size: "4500"
                ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab>
                ```yaml
                world_seeds:
                  - seed: "1000-9999"
                    size: "4000-5000"
                ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab>
                ```yaml

                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **File Cleanup**
        - Removes configured files and directories
        - Supports glob patterns for file matching
        
        <Tabs items={["Basic", "Advanced", "Full"]}>
            <Tab>

                ```
            </Tab>
        </Tabs>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Server Startup**
        - Starts the server
        - Executes post-wipe commands when online
        
        <Callout type="note">
          Post-wipe commands only run after the server is fully online.
        </Callout>

## Schedule Management

### Adding Schedules

<Steps>
    <Step>
        **Create Schedule**
        ```bash
        /schedule add server:rust-main cron:"0 4 * * 4" config:weekly
        ```
        
        <Callout type="note">
          The schedule will use the specified configuration for wipes.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Common Schedules**
        <Tabs items={["Daily", "Weekly", "Monthly", "Custom"]}>
            <Tab>
                ```bash

                ```
            </Tab>
            <Tab>
                ```bash

          Use `/schedule cheatsheet` to see more cron expression examples.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing Schedules

<Steps>
    <Step>
        **List Schedules**
        ```bash
        /schedule list server:rust-main
        ```
        Shows all schedules for a server with:
        - Schedule ID
        - Cron expression
        - Next run time
        - Configuration used
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **View Schedule**
        ```bash
        /schedule show job:12345
        ```
        Displays detailed schedule information:
        - Server details
        - Configuration used
        - Last run status
        - Next run time
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Toggle Schedule**
        ```bash
        /schedule toggle job:12345
        ```
        
        <Callout type="note">
          Disabled schedules remain in the system but won't execute.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Delete Schedule**
        ```bash
        /schedule delete job:12345
        ```
        
        <Callout type="warning">
          This action cannot be undone. The schedule will be permanently removed.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
</Steps>

### Manual Execution

<Steps>
    <Step>
        **Run Schedule**
        ```bash
        /schedule run job:12345
        ```
        Executes a scheduled wipe immediately.
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Force Wipe**
        ```bash
        /schedule run job:12345 force:true
        ```
        
        <Callout type="warning">
          Force execution ignores the cooldown period between wipes.
        </Callout>
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<Steps>
    <Step>
        **Schedule Planning**
        - Set wipes during low-activity periods
        - Consider player timezone distribution
        - Allow sufficient time for backups
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Configuration Management**
        - Test configurations on staging servers
        - Keep backups of working configurations
        - Document custom settings
    </Step>
    <Step>
        **Monitoring**
        - Check schedule execution logs
        - Monitor server performance after wipes
        - Verify plugin functionality
    </Step>
</Steps>
